# Student Performance Analytics

## Project Overview

This project analyzes academic performance data of Portuguese secondary school students to uncover key factors influencing their success. Using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn, the project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the UCI Student Performance dataset (`student-por.csv`), which contains demographic, social, and academic information about secondary school students.

## Project Tasks

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Predictive Modeling (Classification and Regression)
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Model Evaluation

## Machine Learning Models

- Classification model to predict if a student will pass or fail
- Regression model to predict the final grade (G3)

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the dataset file `student-por.csv` in your working directory or update the path in the notebook.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Student_Performance_Analytics.ipynb` step-by-step to reproduce the analyses and model results.
3. Requirements:
   - Python 3.x
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn

## Key Findings

- Study time, attendance, parental education, and school/family support are important predictors of student success.
- The classification model achieves good accuracy in predicting pass/fail status.
- The regression model effectively estimates final grades with reasonable accuracy.
